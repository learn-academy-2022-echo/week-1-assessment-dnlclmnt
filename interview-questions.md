# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is a statement giving criteria to be met with data being compared in order for a certain block of code to be executed

Researched answer: Statements that can be used to execute blocks of code if certain conditions are met. "If", "Else", and "Else if" statements are examples of this within JavaScript.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that allows versions of software to be passed back and forth between partners using terminal commands. Github is a website that allows for management of those repositories stored.

Researched answer: Git stands for "Global Information Tracker". Git has allowed for greater collaboration between users and organizations. Github is essential in managing projects that use Git. Github is also cloud-based storage, with several safety measures in place to help ensure that files being passed back and forth with Git are as secure as possible.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Comparison (relational) operators. These include <, >, <=, >=, == (loose equality), === (strict equality), and ! (the bang operator)

Researched answer: The result of comparison operators evaluates to a truth or false value (boolean).

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a location for data. A value is whatever data is given to the right of the assignment operator (=).

Researched answer: A value is the information stored within a variable. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is something being repeated a number of times. One example of this is a for loop. For example, we can use iteration to run certain commands multiple times for multiple items stored inside arrays or objects.

Researched answer: Iteration is used to execute lines or blocks of code within a specified end point. You can utilize conditional statements within these loops, or iterations, to specify certain conditions to be met with each iteration.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The navigator will read and decipher the documentation to the driver, directing and instructing them. The driver will code and can give input on better practices or different ideas.

Researched answer: We will use pair programming extensively in the work force. The navigator will check for bugs and think of problem solving ideas for any errors while the code is being written by the driver.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that takes another function as an argument. For example, we can have one function that will give a randomized string result. We can then pass that string from function 1 into another function that can utilize that randomized string in any number of ways, such as giving a price based on the item passed into it.

2. Jest: An open-source, fast testing framework for JavaScript

3. Objects: Objects are composite data types, utilizing key and value pairs. We can then assign various properties for the objects with these key-value pairs. Example: 
    let objName = {
        firstName: "Daniel",
        lastName: "Clement",
        age: 30
    }
Objects can also utilize dot or bracket notation to access information within the object.

4. Method: A method is a function stored within an object

5. Classes: Functions that have expressions and declarations that serve as a template for an object.
